**Why should I use it?**

With Fuse.js, you don’t need to setup a dedicated backend just to handle search.
Simplicity and performance were the main criteria when developing this library.

**When should I use It?**

It might not make sense for every situation, but can be ideal depending on your search requirements. For example:

When you want client-side fuzzy searching of small to moderately large data sets.
When you can’t justify setting up a dedicated backend simply to handle search. ElasticSearch or Algolia, although both great services, may be overkill for your particular use cases.
