Hono - means flame🔥 in Japanese - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.

## Features

- Ultrafast 🚀 - The router RegExpRouter is really fast. Not using linear loops. Fast.
- Lightweight 🪶 - The hono/tiny preset is under 14kB. Hono has zero dependencies and uses only the Web Standards.
- Multi-runtime 🌍 - Works on Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, AWS Lambda, or Node.js. The same code runs on all platforms.
- Batteries Included 🔋 - Hono has built-in middleware, custom middleware, third-party middleware, and helpers. Batteries included.
- Delightful DX 😃 - Super clean APIs. First-class TypeScript support. Now, we've got "Types".
