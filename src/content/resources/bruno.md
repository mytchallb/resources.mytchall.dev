Bruno is a Fast and Git-Friendly Opensource API client, aimed at revolutionizing the status quo represented by Postman, Insomnia, and similar tools out there.

Open-source community and extensibility are our cornerstones. We're proud to be an API-client and commit to not bloating our product with unnecessary 'platform' features.

Collaboration requires context and a shared location. Collections can live directly in your Git provider so they're always versioned.

We take security and privacy seriously. Bruno is an offline tool and there is no syncing of your data to any cloud.
