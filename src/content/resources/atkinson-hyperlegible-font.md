At Braille Institute, we’ve created a family of hyperlegible™ fonts designed to improve legibility and readability for individuals with low vision. These carefully crafted fonts feature clear, highly distinctive letters and numbers that make reading easier and more accessible.

Our award-winning font has made reading easier for millions upon millions of people and continues to change lives daily. Good news, it’s free for everyone—from personal use to all commercial applications.

When we designed it in 2019, the Atkinson Hyperlegible™ font won Fast Company’s Innovation by Design Award. In 2024, it was officially added to the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum’s permanent collection.

The hyperlegible™ family of fonts is now available in three versions: Atkinson Hyperlegible™, Atkinson Hyperlegible Next™, and Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono™.
