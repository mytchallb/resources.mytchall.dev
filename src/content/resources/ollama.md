Ollama lets you run and manage large language models (like Llama 2, Mistral, etc.) locally with a simple CLI and API. It handles model downloading, GPU/CPU execution, and prompt management out of the boxâ€”ideal for integrating LLMs into local apps or dev workflows.

Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
