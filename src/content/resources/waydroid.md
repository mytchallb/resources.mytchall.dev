excerpt: "A container-based approach to boot a full Android system on regular GNU/Linux systems running Wayland based desktop environments."
---

Waydroid uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on any GNU/Linux-based platform (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64). The Android system inside the container has direct access to needed hardware through LXC and the binder interface.

Waydroid brings all the apps you love, right to your desktop, working side by side your Linux applications.
The Android inside the container has direct access to needed hardwares.
The Android runtime environment ships with a minimal customized Android system image based on LineageOS.
