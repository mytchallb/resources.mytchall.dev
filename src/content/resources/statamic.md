Statamic is a modern, clean, and adaptable PHP CMS built on Laravel that can run full-stack, headless, on flat files or databases, or as a static site generator.

Statamic offers a developer-friendly experience with features like YAML-based content management, a powerful templating system using Antlers, and a flexible field system that supports custom field types. The platform includes a robust API for headless implementations and provides built-in caching, asset management, and search capabilities.
